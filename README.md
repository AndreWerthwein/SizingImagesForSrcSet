# Sizing images for `<srcset>`-Attribute

This is a small Processing-Sketch, that automatically generates all the `<srcset>`-Resources needed for an application, when given a directory of Resources.

# How to use?

#. Define necessary `<srcset>`-Values.
#. Prepare a single directory containing all the base-images, for which variations -- based on `<srcset>`-Values -- need to be generated.
#. Input `<srcset>`-Values into the `imageSizes`-Array.
#. Input the _Source Directory_ in `sourcePathName`.
#. Input the _Target Directory_ in `targetPathName`.
#. Hit the "Play"-Button.
